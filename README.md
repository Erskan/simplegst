Super simple video player using Qt and GStreamer.
Uses *playbin2* so we can ignore most of the pipeline work and uses the *XOverlay* interface to render the video on our QtWindow.
This was done to see how simple it would be to get video playing using Qt+GStreamer.
Audio, controls and other features have been ignored.
